# My Personal Portfolio


**Intro**

Hey there! This is a showcase of my skillset. I'm building this portfolio using React, and this is purely a frontend design - so no express, SQL database, etc.

I chose React because I wanted to keep this project looking professional, simple and efficient. Compared to Vanilla JS, which does offer its own unique advantages, I thought that React would be the most effective for this sort of thing as it streamlines a TON of the work between managing Javascript and HTML/CSS interaction. 

I'm also intending to use some elements of 3JS in this project. While I prefer using three JS with Vanilla Javascript for it's ability to customize things on a very low-level, React THREE Fiber, particularly the DREI set of helpers, provides ways to make working with DOM elements very quick and simple. 

While React streamlines Javascript <> DOM interactions, React THREE Fiber will help optimize WebGL rendering against that of the DOM.
